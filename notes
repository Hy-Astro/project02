For bad plots, 
    1. epsilon=1 yielded really bad trajectory for earth-sun
    2. run the earth-jupiter-sun system for 200x jupiter's revolution, graphs unreadable

For ChatGPT-assisted explanations,
    1. help with Plummer sphere - spherical coordinates and vector operations
    2. help with writing repetitive, reusable functions (example: plot functions)

For explanations on long time spent:
    1. sometimes an idea pops up in my mind, such as having a flexible list of snapshot times
        in a plotting function and then having to customize figure dimensions

For confusion,
    1. In NBody.py, I didn't know when to use classes vs functions.
        When looking ahead, I opted for functions in order to optimize from loops to vectorization,
        but this results in a large number of functions in the module with a ton of duplicate codes
